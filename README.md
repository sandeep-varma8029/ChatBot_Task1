# PyTorch Chatbot

This is a simple chatbot created using PyTorch framework. The chatbot is trained on a small dataset of predefined patterns and their corresponding responses. The chatbot uses bag-of-words model to process input text and generate responses based on a trained neural network model using NLP.

## Libraries Used
- numpy
- random
- json
- nltk
- torch
- torch.nn
- typing

## Instructions to Run

1. Install the required libraries using pip or conda package manager.
2. Download the intents.json file and save it in the same directory as the chatbot code.
3. Run the ChatBot_Pytorch_Task1.ipynb notebook and execute the code cells.
4. Once the notebook is executed, a prompt will appear asking for user input.
5. Type in the message and press enter to get a response from the chatbot.
6. To exit the chatbot, type 'quit' in the input prompt.

**Disclaimer:** This is a simple implementation of a chatbot and may not perform well on all types of inputs. The dataset used for training is small and limited, hence the responses generated by the chatbot may not always be accurate or appropriate.
